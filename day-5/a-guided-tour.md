## A Guided Tour

## Introduction
Take us on a guided tour of your scene and or character(s).

## Concepts/Items Covered
CV Curves
Motion Paths
Attaching Cameras to Motion Paths
Animating Cameras
Looking through Camera View

## Part I: Welcome!
1. Create a ```CV Curve``` path through your scene that will help guide us through the best parts of your project.
* Create -> Curve Tools -> CV Curve Tool
2. Right click in your scene to set points of your curve.
3. Press Enter to finish.


## Part II: Just Like the Movies
1. Create a ```Camera and Aim```.
* Create -> Cameras -> Camera and Aim
2. Select both the camera, the aim, and the curve, then go into Constrain -> Motion Paths -> Attach to Motion Path.
3. Press ```Play``` to see what happens.

## Part III: Adjusting the View
1. Right click and hold down on your curve to open up the CV Curve Menu shortcut.
2. Select ```Control Vertex```.
3. Move your vertex as needed to change how high/low the camera view is at a certain point.
4. Select the camera (not the aim). Animate the camera and move it to different positions at different times and see how it will continue to keep its aim at the path.

## Part IV: Hide the Strings!
1. If you want to hide the path and the aim of the camera, click on them and go into Display -> Hide -> Hide Selection.

## Stretch Goals
1. You are the director! Make it as cinematic as possible. 
2. Remember, each object has its own set of animations. Position the camera to capture unique angles of other animated objects!
